# xdg-utils-simple

An attempt at more concise and usable, drop-in replacements of some of the `xdg-utils` utility scripts by forking and refactoring them.

For use in the non-desktop-environment setups, like the `i3`, `sway`, `dwm` etc. window manager sessions.

## Current targets

-   [x] `xdg-open`
-   [ ] `xdg-mime`

## Resources
